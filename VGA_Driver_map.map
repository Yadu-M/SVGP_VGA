Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           247 out of   9,312    2%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,025 out of   9,312   21%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,260 out of   4,656   27%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,260 out of   1,260 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,260   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,413 out of   9,312   25%
    Number used as logic:             2,025
    Number used as a route-thru:        388

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                128 out of     232   55%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.12

Peak Memory Usage:  814 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  12 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   12 secs
